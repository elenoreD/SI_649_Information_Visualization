# si649-final-vis

We wanted to tell a story of how COVID-19 has started and has spread all over the world. In the meantime, we also wanted to show and compare how this outbreak is being handled by the governments and the medical systems in the different countries. Some discovered patterns, based on how the medical systems in different countries have been working since day 1, can be used for comparison and future prediction.
With this visualization, the audience is expected to understand more about the spreading pattern of COVID-19 over the time and have a sense of the conditions of medical systems in different countries.
